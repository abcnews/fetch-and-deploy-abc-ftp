# fetch-and-deploy-abc-ftp

Quick and dirty script to fetch some files and deploy. Planning on making it more generic and configurable at a later date.

## Usage

Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/) and set up your `.env` file from the sample.

Then run with `deno task start` or `deno run --allow-all main.ts`
